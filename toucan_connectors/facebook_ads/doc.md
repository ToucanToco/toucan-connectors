You will need to get a client_id and a client_secret, these can be found in your Facebook for Developers account under the Basic menu of your facebook application.

Your Facebook app will need a redirect URI (the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` configuration field your application `Facebook login` settings). You can provide the following URL: **{{redirect_uri}}**

The client_id value is under "App ID" and the client_secret value is under "App Secret".
